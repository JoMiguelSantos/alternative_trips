# Hackathons

This repository will contain all the code generated during my Hackthon's.

## Kiwi Barcelona 2019

This Hackathon's theme was sustainability in Travel and our team decided to build a CO<sup>2</sup> free automated route planner based on the Google Maps API (Directions, Places, Nearby API) which essentially creates a work to Hike/Cycle, around nature points, away from the city centers but close enough to instigate people to go for a cycle/hike often, instead of going by car/plane somewhere else.
